# Naming files for SEO

The following guidelines for naming a file for optimal SEO:

* Use a dash
* Be short but descriptive

## Dash or underscore

Google's algorithm is a secret. Matt Cutts, who worked at Google, advocates using a dash. For more information, see the [YouTube video - Underscores vs. dashes in URLs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQcSFsQyct8).

### Examples of dash and underscore

Using underscore: `jobs_dashboard_AmazonEC2.md`

The underscore is not recognized as a word separator. The search engine sees "jobsdashboardAmazonEC2.md". 

Better using a dash as a separator: `jobs-dashboard-AmazonEC2.md`

## Short but descriptive

The filename should be short, maybe four words in length, but also should describe the document.

### Examples of short file names

Incorrect: `jobs.md`

This filename doesn't tell Google or anyone about the file.

Incorrect: `jobs-dashboard.md` 

Yes, this name does describe the file, but how does this name stand out with the multitude of other files named `jobs-dashboard` on the Internet.

Incorrect: `a-jobs-dashboard-for-an-AmazonEC2-instance.md`

No reason to include words such as "for","the","a","it","to", and so on, in the name.

Correct: `jobs-dashboard-AmazonEC2.md`

Descriptive and uses the dash separator.
