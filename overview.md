This style guide introduces a collection of rules which facilitate the authoring of accessible documentation and ensure consistency of contents.

The rules given in this style guide are grouped based on their application to documentation. In outline, this style guide sets rules in the following groups:

Storytelling: how information is delivered to the target audience
Grammar: grammatical structures that should prevail
Text: how to use text components like lists, tables, and graphics

Each rule in this style guide has a title in the form of a concise statement and one or more recommendations to make the rule practical. When necessary, there is a short explanation which gives reasoning why a specific rule is actually needed.
